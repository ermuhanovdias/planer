# Project Rules - Planer

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Vite + React + MUI (Material-UI)
- Backend: Cloudflare Workers + Hono
- Database: Cloudflare D1
- Authentication: Firebase Auth with JWT
- Additional: Cloudflare services ecosystem

## Project Structure
- Follow standard Vite + React project structure
- Keep components modular and reusable
- Separate business logic from UI components
- Use MUI components as primary UI library

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use arrow functions for component definitions
- Keep files focused and single-purpose
- All code comments must be in English only
- All log messages (console.log, errors, debug) must be in English only

## Backend Guidelines
- Use Hono framework for Cloudflare Workers
- Implement proper JWT validation for protected routes
- Use D1 for database operations with proper error handling
- Follow Cloudflare Workers best practices and limitations
- Keep Workers lightweight and efficient

## Authentication
- Use Firebase Auth for user management
- Validate JWT tokens on Cloudflare Workers
- Implement proper auth middleware with Hono
- Handle token refresh and expiration gracefully

## Development Practices
- Always preserve existing functionality when adding features
- Choose the simplest implementation possible
- Continuously simplify and optimize code
- Test changes in context of the full application
- Avoid creating documentation files (README, guides) unless explicitly requested
- Ask user before introducing new technologies or languages not in the tech stack

## Database
- Use Cloudflare D1 for relational data
- Write efficient SQL queries
- Handle migrations properly
- Consider D1 limitations (request timeouts, concurrent operations)

## UI/UX
- Use MUI components consistently
- Follow Material Design principles
- Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes
- Maintain consistent styling across the application
